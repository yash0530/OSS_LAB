\begin{abstract}%[\smaller \thetitle\\ \vspace*{1cm} \smaller {\theauthor}]
  Gait analysis is the systematic study of animal locomotion, more
specifically the study of human motion, using the eye and the brain of
observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body
movements, body mechanics, and the activity of the muscles. Modern gait analysis offers a broad variety of
biomechanical parameters through which to quantify gait. This technique
is widely used in sports industries to analyse the fitness of the athletes. It
can also be used for analyse the motion of the person before and after
any surgery to check the recovery of the patientâ€™s movements.
